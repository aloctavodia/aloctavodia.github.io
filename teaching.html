            <p>I am not formally a professor (i.e. I do not get pay for teaching), but I enjoy teaching. I have experience teaching undergrads and grad students, mostly at Universidad Nacional de San Luis. I have given tutorials and workshops to audiences with diverse academic backgrounds.</p> 
            <p>On the right you will find links to some of the material I use to teach and/or code ported to Python from other programming languages.</p>

         I have contributed to port code from "Statistical Rethinking" by Richard McElreath to PyMC3/Python. Now we are working on the second edition.
         I am also working on porting "Bayesian Statistical Methods" by Brian J. Reich and Sujit K. Ghosh.

         Work in progress. I am rewriting the material I use to teach Bayesian courses.

         Work in progress in collaboration with the ArviZ-team. We want to write a simple to use guide related to exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. We are aiming at a balance between theory and practice.

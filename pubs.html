         <a class="pub-links" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01380"> Prior knowledge elicitation: The past, present, and future</a><br/><br/>
Specification of the prior distribution for a Bayesian model is a central part of the Bayesian workflow for data analysis, but it is often difficult even for statistical experts. Prior elicitation transforms domain knowledge of various kinds into well-defined prior distributions, and offers a solution to the prior specification problem, in principle. In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We analyze the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.

         <a class="pub-links" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10754"> Bambi: A simple interface for fitting Bayesian linear models in Python</a><br/><br/>
Bambi (BAyesian Model Building Interface) is an open source Python package that is built on top of the PyMC3 probabilistic programming framework and the ArviZ package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. Bambi makes it easy to specify complex generalized linear hierarchical models using a formula notation similar to those found in the popular R packages lme4, nlme, rstanarm and brms.

         <a class="pub-links" href="17081801.pdf"> Exploring the quality of protein structural models from a Bayesian perspective</a><br/><br/>
We explore how ideas and practices common in Bayesian modeling can be applied to assess the quality of 3D protein structural models. The basic premise of our
approach is that the evaluation of a Bayesian statistical model's fit may reveal aspects of the quality of a structure when the fitted data is related to protein structural properties. Therefore, we fit a Bayesian hierarchical linear regression model to experimental and theoretical 13CÎ± chemical shifts. Then, we propose two complementary approaches
for the evaluation of such fitting: (a) in terms of the expected differences between experimental and posterior predicted values; (b) in terms of the leave-one-out cross-validation
point-wise predictive accuracy. Finally, we present visualizations that can help interpret these evaluations.

ArviZ is a Python Library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models in Python including: Diagnoses of the quality of the inference Model criticism, evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions, model selection and model averaging, preparation of the results for a particular audience. ArviZ has support for several probabilistic programing libraries in Python, like PyMC, PyStan, Pyro, emcee, NumPyro, Tensorflow Probability. Additionaly it can be even used from Julia.

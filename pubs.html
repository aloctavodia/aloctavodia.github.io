ArviZ is a Python Library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models in Python including: Diagnoses of the quality of the inference Model criticism, evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions, model selection and model averaging, preparation of the results for a particular audience. ArviZ has support for several probabilistic programing libraries in Python, like PyMC, PyStan, Pyro, emcee, NumPyro, Tensorflow Probability. Additionaly it can be even used from Julia.

The second edition of Bayesian Analysis with Python is an introduction to the main concepts of applied Bayesian inference and its practical implementation in Python using PyMC3, a state-of-the-art probabilistic programming library, and ArviZ, a new library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. The main concepts of Bayesian statistics are covered using a practical and computational approach. Synthetic and real data sets are used to introduce several types of models, such as generalized linear models for regression and classification, mixture models, hierarchical models, Gaussian processes, among others.

         <a class="pub-links" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10754"> Bambi: A simple interface for fitting Bayesian linear models in Python</a><br/><br/>
Bambi (BAyesian Model Building Interface) is an open source Python package that is built on top of the PyMC3 probabilistic programming framework and the ArviZ package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. Bambi makes it easy to specify complex generalized linear hierarchical models using a formula notation similar to those found in the popular R packages lme4, nlme, rstanarm and brms.

         <a class="pub-links" href="17081801.pdf"> Exploring the quality of protein structural models from a Bayesian perspective</a><br/><br/>
We explore how ideas and practices common in Bayesian modeling can be applied to assess the quality of 3D protein structural models. The basic premise of our
approach is that the evaluation of a Bayesian statistical model's fit may reveal aspects of the quality of a structure when the fitted data is related to protein structural properties. Therefore, we fit a Bayesian hierarchical linear regression model to experimental and theoretical 13CÎ± chemical shifts. Then, we propose two complementary approaches
for the evaluation of such fitting: (a) in terms of the expected differences between experimental and posterior predicted values; (b) in terms of the leave-one-out cross-validation
point-wise predictive accuracy. Finally, we present visualizations that can help interpret these evaluations.

ArviZ is a Python Library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models in Python including: Diagnoses of the quality of the inference Model criticism, evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions, model selection and model averaging, preparation of the results for a particular audience. ArviZ has support for several probabilistic programing libraries in Python, like PyMC, PyStan, Pyro, emcee, NumPyro, Tensorflow Probability. Additionaly it can be even used from Julia.

         <a class="pub-links" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HHBCR9G"> Bayesian Analysis with Python (Book)</a><br/><br/>

The second edition of Bayesian Analysis with Python is an introduction to the main concepts of applied Bayesian inference and its practical implementation in Python using PyMC3, a state-of-the-art probabilistic programming library, and ArviZ, a new library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. The main concepts of Bayesian statistics are covered using a practical and computational approach. Synthetic and real data sets are used to introduce several types of models, such as generalized linear models for regression and classification, mixture models, hierarchical models, Gaussian processes, among others.
